Updated for version 0.0.3

This is the OPeNDAP gateway module. It is used along with OPeNDAP Hyrax.

For information about building the OPeNDAP gateway module, see the
INSTALL file.

This module is a component of the OPeNDAP DAP Server; the server base
software is designed to allow any number of handlers to be configured easily.
See the DAP Server README and INSTALL files for information about
configuration, including how to use this handler.

Test data are also installed, so after installing this handler, Hyrax 
will have data to serve providing an easy way to test your new installation
and to see how a working csv.conf should look. To use this, make sure
that you first install the bes, and that dap-server gets installed too.
Finally, every time you install or reinstall handlers, make sure to restart
the BES and OLFS.

Special options supported by the handler: 
* Gateway.Whitelist - provides a list of URL of the form
    protocol://host.domain:port
that are allowed to be passed through the gateway module. If none
specified, then an error will be thrown during BES initialization. One
URL per line, as in the example below.

example:
  Gateway.Whitelist=http://test.opendap.org/opendap
  Gateway.Whitelist+=http://opendap.rpi.edu/opendap

* Gateway.MimeTypes - provides a list of mappings from data handler
module to returned mime types. These are the default types. Please do
not erase. One per line, as in these default values.

Gateway.MimeTypes=nc:application/x-netcdf
Gateway.MimeTypes+=h4:application/x-hdf
Gateway.MimeTypes+=h5:application/x-hdf5

* Gateway.ProxyHost and Gateway.ProxyPort - provides a way to define a
proxy server that must be used to make the remote request, and the
port to use.

Gateway.ProxyProtocol= 
Gateway.ProxyHost=
Gateway.ProxyPort=

* Using Squid. Squid makes a great cache for the gateway. In our
  testing we have  used Squid only for services running on port 80.

* Using Squid on OS/X. If you're uisng OS/X to run Hyrax, the easiest
  Squid port is SquidMan (http://web.me.com/adg/squidman/index.html).
  We tested version SquidMan 3.0 (Squid 3.1.1). Run the SquidMan
  application and under Preferences... General set the port to
  something like 3218, the cache size to something big (16GB) and
  Maximum object size to 256M. Click 'Save' and you're almost done. 

  Now in the gateway.conf file, set the proxy parameters like so:

      Gateway.ProxyProtocol=http
      Gateway.ProxyHost=localhost
      Gateway.ProxyPort=3218

  assuming you're running both Squid and Hyrax on the same host.

  Restart the BES and you're all set. 

  Make some requests using the gateway
  (http://localhost/opendap/gateway) and click on SquidMan's 'Access
  Log' button to see the caching at work. The first access, which
  fetches the data, will say 'DIRECT/<ip number>' while cache hits
  will be labeled 'NONE/-'.
