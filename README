Updated for version 0.0.3

This is the OPeNDAP gateway module. It is used along with OPeNDAP Hyrax.

For information about building the OPeNDAP gateway module, see the
INSTALL file.

This module is a component of the OPeNDAP DAP Server; the server base
software is designed to allow any number of handlers to be configured easily.
See the DAP Server README and INSTALL files for information about
configuration, including how to use this handler.

Test data are also installed, so after installing this handler, Hyrax 
will have data to serve providing an easy way to test your new installation
and to see how a working csv.conf should look. To use this, make sure
that you first install the bes, and that dap-server gets installed too.
Finally, every time you install or reinstall handlers, make sure to restart
the BES and OLFS.

Special options supported by the handler: 
* Gateway.Whitelist - provides a list of URL of the form
    protocol://host.domain:port
that are allowed to be passed through the gateway module. If none
specified, then an error will be thrown during BES initialization. One
URL per line, as in the example below.

example:
  Gateway.Whitelist=http://test.opendap.org/opendap
  Gateway.Whitelist+=http://opendap.rpi.edu/opendap

* Gateway.MimeTypes - provides a list of mappings from data handler
module to returned mime types. These are the default types. Please do
not erase. One per line, as in these default values.

Gateway.MimeTypes=nc:application/x-netcdf
Gateway.MimeTypes+=h4:application/x-hdf
Gateway.MimeTypes+=h5:application/x-hdf5

* Gateway.ProxyHost and Gateway.ProxyPort - provides a way to define a
proxy server that must be used to make the remote request, and the
port to use.

Gateway.ProxyHost=
Gateway.ProxyPort=
