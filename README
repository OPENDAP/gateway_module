This is the OPeNDAP Gateway Module. It is used along with Hyrax.

For information about building the OPeNDAP Gateway Module, see the
INSTALL file.

This module is a component of the OPeNDAP DAP Server; the server base
software is designed to allow any number of handlers to be configured easily.
See the DAP Server README and INSTALL files for information about
configuration, including how to use this handler.

Special options supported by the handler: 
* ShowSharedDimensions: Include shared dimensions as separate variables. 
Accepted values: true,yes|false,no, defaults to false.
Example: "NC.ShowSharedDimensions=false"

To use this, make sure that you first install the bes, and that
dap-server gets installed too.  Finally, every time you install or
reinstall handlers, make sure to restart the BES and OLFS.
